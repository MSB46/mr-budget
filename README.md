This is a school project. That's it.

*Mr Budget Demo Edition is released (All changes are not final for the complete version)*
 - The user can now input any number towards the EditText and can be recored towards an ArrayList below using the button
   - Inside each group, there are two items: The date and the category. More items will be added for each group later on
   - At the moment the default category is Entertainment. There is no way of changing it in the demo (that will change later on)
   
 - The user will now be asked to insert a planned budget upon logging in
  - Whatever the user has put for the budget will be displayed on top of the ArrayList. There is no connection to the ArrayList atm
