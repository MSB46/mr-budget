*If you are reading this, chances are that this school project has been completed by now. Hopefully atleast. Although, this can make for a nice little memory later on or now. Thanks for reading. 
                                                                    - Michael B, developer of Mr. Budget (April 12, 2018)*

This is a school project. That's it. 

*Mr Budget Demo Edition (Final Edition?) is released (All changes are probably final unless round 2)*

 - Removed the three activities Food, Entertainment, and Utilities in place of a quicker and more convinient Spinner
 - The spinner has five categories: Food, Entertainment, Utilities, Insurance, and Transportation
 - Upon clicking the button, the user is now asked to add a description of the item they want to add (optional)
 - Categories will now appear in the listview as opposed to Entertainment placeholders
 - Firebase will now record budget, expense, detail, category, and date upon a single press
 - A new activty called "Add" is added (heh) but it is just for show and will not function
 
 
 - changed the ugly hulk green background to a more minty "dollar bill color" green
 - Minor aesthetic changes

*Priority is based on high on the plan is on the todo list*

TODO LIST
 - ~~(SORTA DONE) Find a way to implement actual user input to the listview instead of using placeholders (REPLACE THE PLACEHOLDER VALUES)~~
 
 - ~~Have the app ask the user to input their "balance" (or how much they plan to spend at most)~~
 
 - ~~(NOT STARTED) Make any user input exclusive to their email account~~
 
 - ~~(NOT STARTED) Any other planned features mentioned on the presentation~~ => Can't win em all.
 
 - (???) Teach the app how to do simple subtraction. 
 
 - (ONGOING) Make the app look more appealing => ehh it looks good enough
